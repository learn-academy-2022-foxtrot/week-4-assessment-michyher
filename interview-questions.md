# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: I am not sure what object-oriented programming is but I know that objects can be used when creating functions. Functional programming seems to be focused on the functions at hand. 

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming is a lot more popular then functional programming. It has also been around longer. Object-oriented programming uses methods and objects as key coding elements. And Functional programming uses variables and functions.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: Float refers to a floating number, as far as knowing what that means I am going to research and let you know as soon as I find out. An integer in Ruby I know is a number with no strings around it because that would then make the item a string. 

Researched answer: An integer is a number that has no decimal. And a floating number is a number that has a decimal point. For example: floating number--> 3.3 and integer-->3

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: I think that this is referring to the error where every function in Ruby needs to have a return in order for it to function properly. After this interview, I would love to send you what I find after researching more into this topic. 

Researched answer: Implicit returns are returning values without needing to use the word return. If a return is the last expression then there's no need to return again.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in ruby is usually a method that doesn't belong to an object. Blocks usually look like actual blocks of code. 

Researched answer: A block in ruby is basically a method that doesn't belong to an object. These blocks are useful because it lets you save code and use it later. 

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: I know that hashes are used in Ruby and I would love to send you more infomation once I research this topic further. 

Researched answer: In order to extract a hash in Ruby, you use this ( =>) followed by the key name in brackets.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: this is a free open sourced relational database system. It was first named POSTGRES.

2. Ruby on Rails: this is a server wide application framework that lives within Ruby.

3. ORM: this stands for object-relational mapping. This is a programming technique for when you want to convert data between type systems.

4. Active Record: this is an architectural pattern and it's a software that stores "in-memory" object data.

5. Migrations: this is the movement of code from one system to another. There's 3 levels to this and they all increase complexity, cost and risk.
